Medication Harmonizaton Repository, FHS-BAP

Program scripts to generate FHS-BAP harmonized medication dataset format

The purpose of these codes is to allow users to create similar data structure and naming convention to that of the FHS-BAP harmonized medication datasets, as shown in the coding manuals. The order of the variables may vary from the manual. The naming convention of these variables aligned for that of the FHS-BAP curated datasets: https://github.com/FHS-BAP/Curated-Datasets 

The narrated tutorial regarding the data processing and variables within the datasets can be found: https://mymedia.bu.edu/media/t/1_ysh955cu 

Please ensure you have the listed datasets meantioned in the script header to run the codes optimally.
